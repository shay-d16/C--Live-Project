# C-Sharp-Live-Project


## Theater Company Website
This repository consists of screenshots from my work in a C# Live Project. In this live project, I participated in a team project in which we created software designed for a theater company to manage it's website content without needing any technical knowledge. It has multiple areas to manage admin needs, subscriber needs, and general public needs. The site includes information on the current season, past productions, the current cast members, etc. It allows the acting company to easily upload content, and allows subscribers to easily manage their subscriptions. Using Microsoft Azure Devops, we utilized project management methodologies, such as Agile and Scrum, and clean version control to create this MVC application. I was tasked with creating view for the About page, as well as creating a Comment model in the Blog area and using Entity Framework to scaffold the CRUD pages for that model.
